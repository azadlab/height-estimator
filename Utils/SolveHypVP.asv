function [VanishingPoint, numofResuluts] = SolveHypVP( lines )
%This function is to compute the vanishing point from the given hypothesis which includes three
%lines with unknown relationships. 
%For three lines, there are 3 cases of configurations in Manhattan world.
%case1: three lines are othogonal to each in space.
%case2: two lines are parallel and the third line is orthogonal to them.
%case3: three lines are parallel to each other. Since in this case, there
%       are infinite number of camera orientations, so we ignore this case.
%input: lines -- three image lines in the Manhattan world, line(i,:) = [i,
%                startPointx, startPointy, endPointx, endPointy]
%Output: vanishingPoint -- [vaniX, vaniY, vaniZ]; 
%                           vaniX: the vanishing point of lines which are parallel to X axis. 
%                           vaniY: the vanishing point of lines which are parallel to Y axis. 
%                           vaniZ: the vanishing point of lines which are parallel to Z axis. 
%        numofResuluts  -- number of possible solutions

%first, find the solution of case 1.
configuration = 1;
[vp1, num1] = EstimateVanishinPointFrom3Lines(lines, configuration);
%second, find the solution of case 2. 
%for case2, there are three possible solutions. 
%i.e. line1 // line2, line1 // line3, or line2// line3
configuration = 2;
[vp2, num2] = EstimateVanishinPointFrom3Lines(lines([1,2,3],:), configuration);%line1 // line2
